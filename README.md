# Custom Bazzite-Deck Image

This is my custom Bazzite image for my Steam Deck.

You can build your own at https://github.com/ublue-os/image-template

## Install

From an existing Bazzite installation switch to the custom image:

```bash
sudo bootc switch --enforce-container-sigpolicy ghcr.io/alterNERDtive/bazzite-deck:latest
```

Afterwards, run

```bash
ujust nerd-install-flatpaks
ujust nerd-install-appimages
```

or

```bash
ujust nerd-install
```

to install my list of â€¦ well, those things.
